# PseudoComposer
Small Java program that algorithmically composes music in the style of J.S. Bach, made for my CAP 3027 final project

The UI is currently very ugly, and the project is largely unfinished - I plan to use it as a starting point for a much 
larger project that will compose in the style of multiple composers.
